<h2>Principle:</h2>
<p>Manganese exists in the soil principally as manganese dioxide, which is very insoluble in water containing carbon dioxide. Under anaerobic conditions, the manganese in the dioxide form is reduced from an oxidation state of IV to II and solution occurs. The manganese in ground water is of divalent form. It may be present in trivalent or quadrivalent form also.
</p>
<p>The concentration of manganese seldom exceeds a few mg/L. So colorimetric methods are applicable. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Persulphate Method</p>
<p>(2) Periodate Method</p>
<p>Both methods depend upon oxidation of manganese from its lower oxidation state to VII where it forms the highly coloured permanganate ion. The colour produced is directly proportional to the concentration of manganese present over a considerable range of concentration in accordance with Beer’s law. So it can be measured by eye or photometric means. Provisions must be made to overcome the influence of chlorides. Manganese can also be determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Persulphate method is suitable because pretreatment of samples is not required. Chloride concentration is reduced by using mercuric sulphate. Persulphate oxidises manganese to permanganate in the presence of silver nitrate as catalyst. The colour intensity is observed at a wavelength of 525 nm in a spectrophotometer.
</p>
<p>Periodate method is used when concentrations are below 0.1 mg/L. To obtain complete oxidation of small amounts of manganese, silver nitrate is added and the heating time is increased.</p>
