<h2>Apparatus:</h2>
<p>1.Colorimetric equipment: one of the following is required:</p>
<p>(a) Spectrophotometer, for use at 252 nm, providing a light path of 1 cm or longer.</p>
<p>(b) Nessler tubes, matcheds, 100 mL tall form.<p/>
<p>2.Glassware like conical flasks, measuring cylinder and pipette.</p>
<h2>Reagents:</h2>
<p>1. Special Reagent</p>
<p>2. Ammonium Persulphate</p>
<p>3. Standard Manganese Solution</p>
<p>4. Hydrogen peroxide 30%.</p>
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>1.Take 50 mL of the sample in a conical flask. Add 50 mL distilled water to it.</p>
<p>2.Pipette 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 mL of standard manganese solution to different flasks, and dilute each to 100 mL using distilled water.</p>
<p>3.Add 5 mL special reagent to all the flasks.</p>
<p>4.Concentrate the solutions in all the flasks to about 90 mL boiling.</p>
<p>5.Add 1g ammonium persulphate to all the flasks, bring to boiling and boil for 1 minute.</p>
<p>6.Remove all the flasks from the heat source and let stand for 1 minute.</p>
<p>7.Then cool the flasks under the tap water.</p>
<p>8.Dilute the contents in all the flasks to 100 mL with distilled water and mix. Pour the contents into 100mL Nessler tubes.</p>
<p>9.Match the colour of the sample with that of the colour standards. Note down the concentration of Mn in <span>&#181;</span>g.</p>
<p>10.If the spectrophotometer is used, one distilled water blank has to be prepared along with the colour standards.</p>
<p>11.Measure the absorbance of each solution in a 1cm cell at 525 nm against the reference blank prepared by treating distilled water.</p>
<p>12.Prepare the calibration graph taking meter reading along y-axis and concentration of manganese (in <span>&#181;</span>g) in colour standards on x-axis.</p>
<p>13.Keep the sample in the spectrophotometer and note down the meter reading.</p>
<p>14.Read off from the graph, the corresponding concentration of manganese in <span>&#181;</span>g.</p>
